# React e-commerce website with graphQL api on Apollo server and with opus builder

## General info

Here I'm building e-commerce website, basicly to learn how to use graphql api data from Apollo server and using opus to generate graphql requests.

I have not used any libraries apart from styled-components && opus. I am also only using class components.

The last things to do are: 
- query out of stock products data and compare it with products data
- unmount some components
- handle adding same product but in different config
